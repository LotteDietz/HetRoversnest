Inside the shop you see a tall, thin man with pointed ears and fair hair, pouring hot wax from an iron pan into a mould. The candlemaker is an elf. As he turns to you to speak, you notice his slanted eyes, which are ice-blue. For some reason they appear very cold to you. He tells you that all his coloured candles cost 1 gold piece each [TODO: implement this]. You may buy as many as you wish. He then asks you if you would like to see one of his magic candles in the back room.
