Inside the shop you see a tall, thin man with pointed 
ears and fair hair, pouring hot wax from an iron pan 
into a mould. The candlemaker is an Elf. As he turns 
to you to speak, you notice his slanted eyes, which 
are ice blue- For some reason they appear very cold 
to you. He tells you that all his coloured candies cost 
1 Gold Piece each. You may buy as many as you 
wish. He then asks you if you would like to see one 
of his magic candles in the back room.
