You lift the lid of the sarcophagus and see a 
human body completely encased in old bandages. 
The light, although dim, has disturbed the sleep of a 
mummy, and it sits up, turning its head from side to 
side. It senses where you are and starts to climb out 
of its sarcophagus. It walks towards you with its 
arms extended.
