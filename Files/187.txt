You tell the town guards that you have something 
special for them if they let the two of you go. They 
reply that the prisoner is a murderer and that you 
should not help him, but they insist that you bribe 
them or else you too will be taken to the jail. They 
say they are interested in any of the following items: 
magic armour, magic rings or magic potions. 
[1] If you 
wish to give them one of the items they require
[2] If you do not have any of the items that the 
guards require
