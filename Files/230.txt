You scratch around in the cracks in the wall and find 
a loose stone. The old man watches intently as you 
pull the stone out of the wall. Peering into the hole 
you see an iron key. You place it in the lock of your 
cell andareamazed to feel it turn. Add 1 luck point. 
With the cell door open you put the key back in the 
hole in the wall and replace the stone. You leave 
your cell and pick up your sword off the table.
