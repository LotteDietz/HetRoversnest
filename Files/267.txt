The two guards holding you look at each other and 
then at the other guard for a decision. He nods at 
them and they release their grip on you. As you pay 
him the 10 Gold Pieces he gives you a piercing look, 
saying, If Lord Azzur finds out that you are in the 
city without a pass, you're as good as dead. And as 
for Nicodemus, find him yourself.' Suppressing an 
urge to draw your sword, you lurn and walk into 
the city.
