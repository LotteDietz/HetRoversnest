Once inside the shop you realize why the windows 
are barred - it is a jeweller's shop. Standing behind 
the glass counter is a huge bald-headed man with an 
eye-patch covering his left eye- He gives you a 
welcoming smile but the sight of his ugly mouth 
with its few black-stained teeth does not inspire 
confidence. A large battle-axe hangs conveniently 
behind the man to deter any would-be robbers. 
On display are several ornate rings inset with 
diamonds, emeralds and rubies. The man asks 
whether you are buying or selling. Will you: 
[1] Ask the price of the rings?
[2] Offer to sell him geins (if you have them)?
[3] Attack him with your sword?
