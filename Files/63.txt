The Elf leads you into a room lit by purple candles, 
which give a strange glow, You stand and stare 
blankly at the candles and drift off into a world of 
vivid dreams. While you are in this trance, the Elf 
takes two items and 5 Gold Pieces from your back- 
pack (if you have them). When you awake, you 
have no recollection of the theft and leave the shop 
thanking the Elf for showing you his beautiful candles. Outside you head east again.
