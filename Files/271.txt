Asleep in their bunks are three pirates. Their room 
is small and contains only clothing and a few per- 
sonal possessions. It looks as if the pirates have 
been drinking and gambling - there is an uncorked 
bottle of nim, a mug and a pack of cards on top of a 
barrel in the centre of the room. You see that one of 
the pirates is wearing a small leather pouch around 
his neck.
