You push the man through the doorway and run 
him through with your sword. Much to your surprise he is unaffected by the wound. 
Slowly he advances towards you, trying to touch your skin 
wilh his skeletal, decayed hands. He grabs your arm 
but you manage to kick him away. He has left a 
mark on your arm which looks like a burn, but it 
emits a revolting smell of putrid flesh. Lose 2 stamina points. 
Then you realize that before you stands 
a Spirit Stalker, one of the faithful servants of Zanbar Bone. 
As he advances towards you again with 
his arms outstretched, you try to remember what 
you must do. Will you:
