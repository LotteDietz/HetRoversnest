The Dwarf explains that they are playing a simple 
winner-takes-all dice game. The stakes are 2 gold 
pieces. Each person will stake 2 gold pieces and roll 
two dice. The person rolling the highest number 
collects the 8 gold pieces. To play, roll two dice 
three limes for the three Dwarfs and make a note of 
each total. Next, roll two dice for yourself. If your 
own total is higher than each of the other three 
totals, you win 6 gold pieces from the Dwarfs. If the 
total is' less than any of the other three totals, you 
lose 2 Gold Pieces. You may play four times if you 
wish to before the Dwarfs get bored and leave the 
tavern.
