The Dwarf explains that they are playing a simple 
winner-takes-all dice game. The stakes are 2 Gold 
Pieces. Each person will stake 2 Gold Pieces and roll 
two dice. The person rolling the highest number 
collects the 8 Gold Pieces. To play, roll two dice 
three limes for the three Dwarfs and make a note of 
each total. Next, roll two dice for yourself. If your 
own total is higher than each of the other three 
totals, you win 6 Gold Pieces from the Dwarfs. If the 
total is' less than any of the other three totals, you 
lose 2 Gold Pieces. You may play four times if you 
wish to before the Dwarfs get bored and leave the 
tavern. At the end of the game you leave the tavern 
yourself to head north. [TODO:Actually play this game]
