The archway lends into a large room in the centre of 
which crouches a human-like creature, some three 
metres tall. He looks very worried and is muttering 
to himself. The lumps on his face are the distinguishing marks of an Ogre. Will you: 
[1] Attempt to speak with him?
[2] Attack him with your sword?
[3] Leave the house to head north?
