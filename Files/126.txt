The little girl grabs hold of your arm and leads you 
into a back room. Saying nothing, she motions you 
to lie down on a sheepskin rug. Suddenly you are 
aware of a very old man sitting opposite. He rises 
slowly from his rocking chair and walks over to you. 
You watch transfixed as he takes hold of an arrow 
protruding from your arm and gently pulls it free 
without causing you any pain. The wound made 
by the arrow disappears before your eyes. Other 
arrows are treated similarly if you suffered more 
than one wound. You may restore 2 stamina 
points for each arrow [TODO: how many?]
pulled free by the old man. 
Then in a slow and almost inaudible voice he tells 
you that he wants the broadsword that Owen Carralif gave you in payment for the healing. You feel 
obliged to give him your sword, though reluctantly. 
In exchange he gives you an ordinary fighting 
sword. As a net effect, your skill score gets reduced by 1.
