You walk into a room with sparse furnishings and a 
polished wooden floor. Silk curtains hang down 
oyer an archway on the far wall. As you start to walk 
across the wooden floor, a woman's voice calls out 
'Who is it?' You may: 
[1] Tell her you are delivering flowers 
[2] Tell her you have come to collect old rags 
[3] Tell her you are a tax collector
