The trolls watch carefully as you open your backpack. You give them all your gold except for 1 Gold 
Piece which you manage to palm without their 
noticing. They then place themselves on either side 
of you and inarch you along Mill Street until you 
reach the city's North Gate at the junction with 
Goose Street. They tell the two guards on duty not 
to let you back into Port Blacksand. They give you a 
forceful boot up the backside and you land sprawling on the dusty road outside. Do you have all the 
items required to slay the Night Prince, and have 
you been tattooed?
