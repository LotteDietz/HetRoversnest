You soon realize you are in a stable when you see a 
large, bare-chested man wearing a grubby while 
apron busy at work at an open fire. He takes a 
red-hol iron bar from the fire with his gloved 
hand and starts to hammer it into the shape of a 
horseshoe on his anvil. Sweat pours from his brow 
as he toils with the hammer. Will you:
[1] Make conversation with the blacksmith?
[2] Attack him with your sword?
[3] Leave him to his labours and continue north?
