The street makes a sudden right turn and heads 
north. You pass a cluster of small houses and are 
aware of unseen people watching you walk by. 
Then the door to one of the houses opens and a 
small boy dressed in rags runs out and hands you a 
piece of paper. Without stopping, he runs off and 
disappears round the corner. The paper has a mes-

pointed at you. Leave 10 Cold Pieces in the middle 
of the street and keep walking.'
