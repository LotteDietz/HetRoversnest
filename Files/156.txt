Standing on eitherside of you, the Trolls march you 
along Mill Street until you reach the city's North 
Gate at the junction with Goose Street. They tell the 
two guards on duty not lo let you back into Port 
Blacksand. They give you a forceful boot up the 
backside and you land sprawling on the dusty road 
outside. Do you have all the items required to slay 
the Night Prince?
