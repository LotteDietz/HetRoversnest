Ahead you see a wooden bridge stretching over a 
dirty river- Various bits of rubbish are floating down 
to the sea on its black surface, and you squirm at the 
sight of a human hand passing by. The bridge 
supports and columns reach high above and < 
see skulls, both human and non-human, 
them. The wind makes an eerie noise as it whistles 
through the bridge structures, reminding you of 
tortured souls crying out for help. Almost hidden 
from view is a small flight of steps going down 
underneath the bridge from where you are stand- 
ing. A one-legged man carrying a sack is crossing 
the bridge from the northern bank.
