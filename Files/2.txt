Yon remove the bracelet from your wrist and toss it 
at the oncoming monster. It lands on its armour-like 
shell and sticks to it like glue. You then watch as the 
bracelet starts to burn its way through the shell into 
the body of the Giant Centipede. Smoke rises from 
the neat round hole and as the bracelet bums deeper 
you can see from the frantic movements of the 
Centipede that it is in its death throes. Finally it is 
Still and you manage to squeeze yourself between 
its body and the roof of the tunnel. You walk 
further down the tunnel, which ends at an iron grill 
through which the sewage runs.
