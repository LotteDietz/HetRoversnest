There are over twenty guards coming to get you and 
it is useless to put up a fight. They drag you off to a 
room at the bottom of the tower and chain you to a 
wall. To your horror you see the two trolls enter the 
room. They take it in turns to beat you before 
passing a sentence of five years' solitary confinement in a dungeon cell. A few minutes later a 
hunchbacked jailer arrives carrying a bull-hide 
whip. He fixes a ball and chain to your leg before 
leading you downstairs to begin your jail sentence. 
You have failed in your mission.
