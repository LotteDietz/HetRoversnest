The little man smiles and says, 'Easy.' He reaches 
into his pocket and produces some sparkling dust 
which he throws up at you. As it settles on your 
clothes, a feeling of strength surges through your 
body. Add 6 stamina points. He then tells you that 
as he is feeling particularly grateful he will grant you 
another wish. With your strength returned you feel 
you can now deal with Zanbar Bone and ask the 
little man of his whereabouts.
