You pull back the curtains and walk into a very 
lavish boudoir. In it is a young woman with her back
towards you. As you approach her she spins round 
and you are stunned to see, not the young woman's 
face you are expecting, but a large snake's head. It 
extends out from the shoulders and bites you on the 
neck. You are caught somewhat off-balance by the 
SERPENT QUEEN and suffer the loss of 4 stamina 
points and 1 skill point before you can draw your 
sword to defend yourself.
