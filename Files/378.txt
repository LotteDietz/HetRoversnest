Roll one die alternately for yourself and for the 
bare-chested man, to represent the cannon-fcuH pas- 
sing between you. Repeat this process until a 1 is 
thrown, in which case the cannon-tall has 
been dropped and the loser must pay the winner 5 
Gold Pieces. [TODO: Actually implement this] After finishing the game you walk on a 
bit further.
