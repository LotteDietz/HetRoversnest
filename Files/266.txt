The Bays on your side are angry with you for 
losing the match. Some of their supporters rush 
over and start to jostle you. By the time you manage 
to drag yourself over to the wall, everyone in the 
arena seems to have pushed you around. Lose two 
items from your backpack. Eventually you climb 
back over the wall and walk to the junction to head 
west along Harbour Street.
