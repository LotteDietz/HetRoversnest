The blacksmith lakes yourmoney and walks over to 
some bales of hay in the corner. He lifts one up and 
underneath it you see the chainmail coat. He turns 
to you and says, 'You have to hide everything in this 
place. You can't trust anybody.' The coat fits perfectly and its workmanship is excellent. Add 2 skill 
points. You leave the stables with your new armour 
and continue north {turn lo 115).
