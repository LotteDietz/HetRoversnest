The key fits the lock, which clicks.opcn as you turn 
it. You open the door and enter a beautiful marble- 
floored hallway. On three of the four walls hang 
portraits of evil- looking men and women, but on the 
far wall hang two iron shields. The crest on one is a 
tower and on the other a unicorn. A spiral staircase 
leads up from the centre of the hallway to a floor 
above. Will you: 
[1] Take the shield with the tower crest?
[2] Take the shield with the unicorn crest?
[3] Climb the spiral staircase?
