The Ogre's room is full of clutter and discarded bits 
and pieces. It does not appear to have been tidied 
for years. Rummaging through the jumble, you find 
a polished wooden box with a hand made of white 
shell inlaid on the lid. The box is locked and you 
cannot find the key to open it. 
[1] If you wish to smash it open with your sword
[2] If you wish to 
leave the house to continue north, without trying to 
open the box
