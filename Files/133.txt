The street ends at a junction with Mill Street, which 
runs east and west along the city wall. Looking east 
you see a group of town guards marching towards 
you and you decide to walk quickly west along Mill 
Street. On your left you see a narrow lane and ahead 
you see a young lad coming towards you pushing a 
barrow laden with fruit. 
[1] If you wish to walk down the lane
[2] If you wish to buy some fruit from the barrow-boy
