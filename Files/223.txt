Sweat breaks out on your forehead - you choose a 
pill and swallow it. Roll one die. If you roll any 
number between 2 and 6, you have chosen a harm- 
less pill. The man reaches into a pouch on his cord 
belt and hands you 20 Cold Pieces. He then bids you 
farewell and tells you to come back soon. You leave 
the room and walk backup the alley to Candle Street. 
A roll of 1 means you die quickly from 
the poisoned pill and your adventure ends here.
