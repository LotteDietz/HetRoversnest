The blacksmith looks surprised at your unprovoked 
aggression and pulls another red-hot iron bar from 
the fire with his gloved hand. He is very angry and 
lunges at you with the bar. 
If the blacksmith wounds you during any Attack 
Round, you must subtract 3 points from your sta- 
mina score because of the burn caused by the iron 
bar [TODO:Actually implement this]
