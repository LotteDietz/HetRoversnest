Sitting behind a small table is a plump woman 
wearing bright yellow clothes and a shawl over her 
head. She smiles as you enter, bidding you to sit 
down. She tells you that a glimpse of the future will 
cost you 2 Gold Pieces. 
[1] If you wish to pay to hear her predictions
[2] If you would rather carry on unaided, leave the tent and head north
