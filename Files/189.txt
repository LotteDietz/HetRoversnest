You take aim with your bow and fire the arrow at the 
Spirit Stalker. The arrow plunges into its chest and 
the agonized look on the face of the Spirit Stalker 
tells you that Ihe arrow has pierced its heart. It falls 
to the floor, and smoke starts to rise from its rotten 
flesh. Its mouth opens to release a deafening howl 
that echoes around the hallway and makes you 
shudder. Finally it is still, and you retrieve your 
silver arrow. You see that you are in a beautiful 
marble-floored hallway. On three of the four walls 
hang portraits of evil-looking men and women, but 
on the far wall hang two iron shields. The crest on 
one is a tower, and on the other a unicorn. A spiral 
staircase leads up from the centre of the hallway to 
the floor above. Will you: 
[1] Take the shield with the tower crest?
[2] Take the shield with the unicorn crest?
[3] Climb the spiral staircase?
