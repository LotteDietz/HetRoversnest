Stepping over the Fire Imp, you walk back to the 
stairs to see if its master is still in the house. You 
descend the stairs slowly, sword drawn. When you 
reach the bottom you are somewhat surprised to see 
a fat man, richly dressed, sitting in an ornate chair 
looking directly at you. He appears very relaxed, 
quite unperturbed by your drawn sword. Then he 
speaks, slowly and coldly, saying, 'For killing my 
pet you shall pay with your life.' Me raises his right 
hand in the air and from his outstretched fingers 
shoot ragged white bolts of lightning. 
Do you wear an ivory skull around your neck?
