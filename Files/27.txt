You enter a small candlelit room With no windows. 
It is empty apart from a table and two chairs. A man 
wearing black robes and a skullcap is standing in a 
corner. He smiles and asks you to sit down at the 
table. He sits opposite you and, after placing six 
white pills on lop of six skulls on the table, looks up 
to you and says. 'One of the pills before you is 
deadly poisonous, the others are harmless. Swallow 
one of your choice. If you live, I will give you 20 
Gold Pieces. If you die, 1 keep all your possessions.'
