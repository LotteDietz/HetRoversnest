You can hear some scratching sounds in the tunnel 
ahead. Then you see a long shadow appear on the 
curved brick wall. In the dim light you can just make 
out the large shape of something black and shiny 
moving towards you. The scratching becomes louder 
and you also hear clicking sounds. The monster is 
only a couple of metres ahead of you when you 
recognize it as a Giant Centipede. Do you possess 
an insect bracelet?
