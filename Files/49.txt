As you draw your sword the guard leaps to his right 
and attempts to ring a small bell on the wall of the 
guardhouse. Test yoiir Luck. If you are Lucky, he 
misses the bell, curses, and turns to fight you with 
his pike. If you are unlucky, he manages 
to grab the bell and rings it loudly before turning to 
fight you with his pike.
