You walk all day until you reach the hill shown on 
Nicodemus's map upon which the Night Prince's 
tower stands. Ail isquietand there isan unpleasant 
smell of decay in the air. Shadows start to creep 
along the ground as the moon rises into the night 
sky and you see the foreboding silhouetted shape of 
Zanbar Bone's tower pointing up into the sky like a 
black finger. You check all your possessions before 
drawing your sword and marching towards the 
arched wooden entrance door. Suddenly you hear a 
shrill howl and swing round to see two pairs of eyes 
staring at you. They belong to two moon dogs, Zanbar Bone's trained killer hounds. Fight them one at a 
time.
