You tell the guard that you wish to sell some silver 
chalices that you stole from a tavern in Silverton and 
that you will pay him a gold piece for his advice as 
to where to go for the best price. The guard looks at 
you suspiciously, saying, 'Let me look at these 
chalices in your backpack before I admit you'. Will 
you: 
[1] Tell him that you know the chalices are cursed and should  only be examined by a mage? 
[2] Try to run past the guard into the main street? 
[3] Attack him quickly with your sword?
