The barrels all contain rotten fruit and the boxes 
contain manacles and leg irons. Perhaps this is a 
slave-trading ship. There is nothing else of interest 
to you on deck. 
[1] If you wish to walk over to the deck 
cabin to climb down the stairs to the lower decks
[2] If you would rather leave the ship, walk 
back along the jetty, turn left and walk north up 
Harbour Street
