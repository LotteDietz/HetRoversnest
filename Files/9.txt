You step back from the vile body of Zanbar Bone, 
waiting for him to decay. However, you have 
chosen wrongly! He pulls the arrow from his chest 
and rubs the compound from his eyes. He sees you 
and laughs. You are mesmerized by his power and 
are unable to move. He walks up to you and touches 
your face with his skeletal fingers. Your life is draining quickly away and you will soon begin your 
undead existence as a servant of Zanbar Bone.
