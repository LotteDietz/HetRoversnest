You take 10 Gold Pieces out of your backpack and 
place them on the palm of the hand outstretched 
before you. The old man then reaches into his inner 
clothing and pulls out an iron key, telling you that it 
will unlock your cell. Almost in disbelief you take 
the key and place it in the lock. Incredibly, the lock 
turns. You look back at the old man and ask him if 
he wishes to escape with you. He smiles and shakes 
his head, saying that he is happy where he is. You 
leave the cell and, picking up your sword, climb the 
stairs to the floor above.
