Just as the guards are about to lead you away, you 
try with all your might to pull your arms from their 
grip. Roll two dice. If the number rolled is less than 
or equal to your skill score, you succeed. If the number rolled is greater than your skill, 
you fail to release yourself, and are led away, strug- 
gling violently.
