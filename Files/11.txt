The Trolls see what you are doing and run towards 
the tree. You are forced to leave your shield behind. 
Lose 1 skill point. After climbing quickly up the 
tree you realize that you must jump a distance of 
two metres between the branch and the top of the 
wall. If you are wearing a chainmail coat you will 
have to take it off in order to jump safely across to 
the wall (lose 2 skill points). Below, you see the 
two Trolls running round the tree waving their 
swords at you. There is no alternative but to jump.
