Coming towards you as fast as he is able is a man in 
tattered rags with a ball and chain attached to his 
leg. He is exhausted and collapses in yourarms- His 
face is dirty and unshaven. With great difficulty he 
manages to speak, saying, 'Please cut me free. The 
town guards are not far behind me. I have been 
locked in a dungeon for two years but managed to 
runnel my way out. I was robbed and unable to pay 
my taxes, so Lord Azzur ordered I should be jailed 
for five years. Please help me.' Farther up the street 
you hear shouting voices and then armed men come 
into view. 
[1] If you want to cut through his chains with 
your sword
[2] If you want to hand him over to the town guards.
