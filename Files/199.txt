You tell the town guards that you are a bountyhunter. They seem pleased that you have caught 
their wanted man. The chief guard walks over to 
you and hands you 5 Gold Pieces, saying, 'This 
murderer won't escape again. Here's your reward.' 
He then rejoins the other guards who are busy 
chaining up the escaped murderer. You decide to 
head quickly north in case the murderer tries to 
implicate you.
