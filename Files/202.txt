The guard replies that he will send for an escort to 
take you to Nicodemus. He reaches up to a small 
bell on the wall of the guardhouse and rings it three 
times. Almost immediately two other guards come 
running out of the house, and you are surprised 
when they each grab hold of one of your arms. The 
guard with the pike looks up to the sky and laughs, 
saying, 'So you want to see Nicodemus, do you? 
How would you like to sec the inside of a dungeon 
cell instead? Guards, take this fool away to be 
shackled, and throw away the key.' Will you: 
[1] Allow yourself to be taken away?
[2] Attempt to fight the guards?
[3] Try to bribe the guards?
