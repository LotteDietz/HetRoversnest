Walking towards you along Ihe street are two huge 
guards wearing the black uniform of Lord Azzur. As 
they get closer you see thai they are Trolls, brutal 
mercenaries employed by Lord Azzur as Imperial 
Elite Guards. To your right there is a Iree which 
reaches almost to the top of the city wall.

[2] If you wish to climb the tree in order to get over the wall
