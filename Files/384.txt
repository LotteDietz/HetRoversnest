As the cudgel swings through the air above your 
head, you punch the Dwarf holding it. He lets out a 
scream and drops the cudgel. Feeling his bleeding 
nose and seeing the blood on his hand, he screams 
again and runs off down the alley. The other two 
Dwarfs holding your legs realize that you are not an 
easy victim and run off after their fellow robber. 
[1] If you wish to chase them down the alley
[2] If you wish to set off west again
