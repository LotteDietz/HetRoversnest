Looking into a crystal ball, she seems to go inlo a 
trance. She tells you that you are searching for a 
man, a wise man with magical powers. She pauses 
for a moment and then draws in a deep breath 
before going on to tell you that the man you ate 
looking for lives in a hut beneath a bridge to the 
north. She warns you to be careful when approaching 
the man, for he docs not welcome strangers. Then she looks away from the crystal ball and 
asks you to leave. Her face seems to be hiding 
something. Has she seen some dreadful fate awaiting you? You decide to leave the tent and head north.
