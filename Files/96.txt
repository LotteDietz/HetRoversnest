You open the door and enter a room which is 
adorned with macabre objects and paintings. A 
black cat is sitting in front of a table coveted in black 
cloth. Two black candles are burning on either side 
of a mirror on the far wall. On the table lies an open 
chest containing a golden skull. Will you: 
[1] Walk over to the chest?
[2] Close the door and open the white door (if you have not done so already)?
[3] Close the door and walk back to the staircase lo climb up to the next floor?
