Eventually the street comes to a dead end at a high 
stone wall. There are stone steps leading to the top 
of the wall. On the other side of the wall you can 
hear grunts, growls and cheering. 
[1] If you wish to climb over the wall
[2] If you wish to walk back to the junction and head west down Harbour Street
