As you take your first step forwards you are alarmed 
to hear the familiar whistle of arrows flying through 
the air. They are coming from windows on either 
side of the street. Roll one die. This is the number of 
arrows that will hit you and each will cause you to 
lose 3 stamina points. If you are still alive, lose 2 
luck points and turn to 327.
