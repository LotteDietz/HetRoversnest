Sitting on a stool at the back of the shop is an old 
bespectacled Dwarf. He is busy cutting a key on a 
cast-iron treadle machine which squeaks and 
grinds noisily. You cough to get his attention, but he 
docs not look up from his work. Finally the machine 
comes to a halt and the Dwarf asks you what you 
want.
[1] ask him if he has any skeleton keys for sale 
[2] ask him if he knows where Nicodemus lives
