Sitting on a stool at the back of the shop is an old bespectacled dwarf. He is busy cutting a key on a cast-iron treadle machine which squeaks and grinds noisily. You cough to get his attention, but he docs not look up from his work. Finally the machine comes to a halt and the dwarf asks you what you want.
