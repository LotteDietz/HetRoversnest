It is gloomy in the house but you can make out the 
shapes of abandoned furniture. Litter and rubble is 
strewn all over the floor. You find a broken chair 
and slump down in it to rest. Suddenly you notice 
something slither across the floor, and before you 
can get to your feet you see in the half-light that you 
are encircled by six snakes, each a metre long.
