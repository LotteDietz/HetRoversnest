It is gloomy in the house but you can make out the shapes of abandoned furniture. Litter and rubble is strewn all over the floor. You find a broken chair and slump down in it to rest. Suddenly you notice something slither across the floor, and before you can get to your feet you see in the half-light that you are encircled by six snakes, each a metre long.
