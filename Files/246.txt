As you walk warily down the narrow cobbled street, 
you are suddenly confronted by a little old man who 
dashes out of one of the houses. He pulls a dirty 
bottle out of a canvas bag. As he speaks, you can't 
help staring at the large wart on his nose, with its 
tuft of hair. He smiles and asks it you would tike to 
pay 2 Gold Pieces for a drink of his wonderful 
healing potion. 
[1] If you wish to pay for a drink
[2] If you would rather keep going east
