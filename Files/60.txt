At the top of the stairs you reach a landing with two 
closed doors. As you are deciding which door to 
enter, you hear a noise from downstairs. Somebody 
is entering the front door. Then you hear a man's 
voice saying, 'Off you fly, my little beauty, find the 
intruder'.
[1] If you wish to draw your sword in readiness
[2] If you would rather make a break 
for it, you may jump out of the window at the head 
of the landing into the street below
