The larger of the two Trolls tells you that you are 
under arrest for being in Port Blacksand without 
authorization. Me tells you that he is feeling gen- 
erous, however, and offers you a choice. You can 
pay a fine of all the gold in your backpack and be 
thrown out of the city, or spend a year with rats and 
cockroaches in a dirty dungeon cell, the other Troll 
bursls out laughing, saying, 'Generous? Ho! Ho! 
Ho! Ah. Sourbelly, you've got such a sense of humour!' 
[1] If you wish to pay the fine and be thrown out of the city
[2] If you wish to resist arrest
