You leave Zanbar Bone's black lower as quickly as 
you can, not wishing to spend another moment in 
the infernal place. Before leaving, however, you set 
it alight so that no evil entity may ever again use it 
for foul deeds. You sleep the rest of the night and 
long into the next morning in a hayfield, before 
setting off for Silverton in the afternoon. Battle- 
weary and hungry, you arrive in Silverton the same 
evening. You are given a hem's welcome and gift 
after gift is bestowed upon you. A feast is arranged 
and there is laughter, music and drinking in all the 
streels. Finally, Owen Carralif makes a speech and 
presents you with a gold orb worth hundreds of 
Gold Pieces. The people of Silverton are joyous 
again.
