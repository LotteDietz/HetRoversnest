You decide to fight the dogs.
You must fight them both at the same time. 
Both dogs will make a separate attack on you in each 
Attack Round, but you must choose which of the 
two you will fight. Attack your chosen dog as in a 
normal battle. Against the other you will throw for 
your Attack Strength in the normal way, but you 
will not wound it if your Attack Strength is greater; 
you must just count this as though you have de- 
fended yourself against its bite. Of course if its 
Attack Strength is greater, it will wound you.
