You sheathe your sword and look round at the 
circle of spectators. Having witnessed your excel- 
lent swordsmanship each goes quietly back to his 
table, not wishing to anger you any further. The 
innkeeper apologue* for his unfriendliness and 
invites you to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink at his 
etpense. You ask him if he knows the whereabouts 
of Nicodemus. The innkeeper frowns and looks at 
you inquiringly. Then he says. 'I don't know what 
vou want from that wily old wizard He keeps 
himself to hrnisell and lives alone in a small hul 
under Singing Bridge. Keep walking north along 
Market Street, through the market-place, and you'll 
come toa bridge that crosses Catfish River and leads 
tn the old pari of the city and the harbour. Nico- 
demus won't talk to you and he knows enough 
magic to keep even the toughest away from his 
door.' You tell the innkeeper not to be so discour- 
teous to strangers next time, and leave the tavern to 
head north.
