Although many of the items in the room are ex- 
tremely valuable, they are not of much use to you on 
your quest. However, something strange catches 
your eye. On a mahogany card table lie three up- 
turned silver goblets. One is inscribed with the 
letter A, another with B and another with C. Will 
you: 
[1] Pick up goblet A?
[2] Pick up goblet B?
[3] Pick up goblet C?
[4] VValk through the archway?
[5] Climb the stairs?
