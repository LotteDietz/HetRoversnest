Walking along the street you are suddenly halted by 
a plant pot smashing on to the cobblestones in front 
of you. You look to the left and see an open window. 
Inside, voices can be heard arguing. The door to tho 
house is open. 
[1] If you wish to enter the house to find 
out what the argument is about
[2] If you 
would rather ignore the argument and continue 
east
