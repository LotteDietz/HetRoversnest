You push the door with your shoulder with all your 
might. Roll two dice. If the number rolled is less 
than or equal to your skill score, the door flies 
open. If the number rolled is greater 
than your skill, the door remains firmly shut. You 
decide not to risk injury to yourself and walk back to 
the street, continuing northwards.
