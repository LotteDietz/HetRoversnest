The houses on the right-hand side of the street are 
small and weather-beaten. Old women sit outside 
on the front steps cleaning fish and mending fishing 
nets. They are large and jolly, talking to each other 
and frequently rolling about, bellowing with laughter. The fishermen do not appear to be at home. The 
street and the quayside come to an end at a great 
iron anchor. You turn round and walk back towards 
the junction.
