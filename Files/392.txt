The creature is outraged that you have stolen one of its brooches. It jumps up and you notice flames curling up from its nostrils. Suddenly a blast of fire shoots from its jaw and it moves towards you with outstretched claws. The blast misses you.
As well as following the usual rules of battle, throw 
one die every Attack Round for the Lizardme's 
fiery breath. On a roll of 1. 2or 3, it burns you for 2 
point of damage to be subtracted from your stamina. On a roll of 4, 5 or 6 you manage to dodge the 
blast. You may use your luck against the fire.
[TODO:Actually implement this]
You may also escape by running back down the stairs out of the house to head north.
