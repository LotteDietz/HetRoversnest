The silk curtains in front of the archway are pulled 
aside and a strange creature steps into the room. It 
has a snake's head, which sits oddly atop the body 
of a young woman wearing a lavish gown. You feel 
uncomfortable and are undecided whether or not to 
draw your sword. Then the snake's mouth opens 
and a forked tongue darts in and out as the Serpent 
Queen asks to see the flowers sent to her by Lord 
Azzur. Do you have a bunch of flowers?
