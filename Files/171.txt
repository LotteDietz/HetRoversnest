The street gradually starts to run downhill. The 
houses end at a tavern called the Black Lobster and 
the street opens out on to a quayside. A stone jetty 
runs out to sea and tied to it is an old galleon. It is 
flying the skull and crossbones and is probably one 
of the many pirate ships that anchor in Port Blacksand to 
offtoad their booty. Harbour Street turns 
right at the jetty and runs north parallel to the shore 
as far as you can see. If
[1] you wish to walk down the jetty to climb on board the ship
