Your question produces a suspicious look on the 
face of the Dwarf and he raises one eyebrow. Then 
he says, '1 know Nicodemus but what do you want 
of him?' You may reply by 
[1] telling him either that you are on a mission from Silverton and need the help of Nicodemus
[2] telling him that you want to kill Nicodemus
