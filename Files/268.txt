The silk curtains in front of the archway are pulled 
aside and a strange creature steps into the room. It 
has a snake's head, which sits oddly on the shoulders of a young woman wearing a lavish gown. Its 
mouth opens and a forked tongue darts in and out 
as the Serpent Queen starts to accuse you, shouting, 
'I ordered no flowers from Mrs Pipe, and she certainly would not send any as a gift. What trickery is 
this, rogue?'. You start to panic, deciding what to do 
next.

[2] If you wish to draw your sword to attack the Serpent 
Queen
