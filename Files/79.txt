The silk curtains in front of the archway are sudden- 
ly pulled aside and a strange creature steps into the 
room. It has a snake's head, which sits oddly atop 
the body of a young woman wearing a lavish gown. 
Its mouth opens and a forked tongue darts in and 
out as the serpent queen challenges you, 
saying, 'Do not lie to me, scoundrel. No doubt you 
are an assassin come here to kill me. But you shall 
die instead!' Suddenly the Serpent Queen stretches 
out her head and bites you on the neck. Lose 4 
stamina points and 1 skill point.
