The old wooden doors open into a dingy, smoke- 
iilled room. There are eight round tables in the 
centre of the room with some of the most mean and 
shifty-looking rogues you have ever seen sitting at 
them. At the back of the tavern is a long wooden bar 
covered with bottles and mugs. Behind the bar 
itands the innkeeper wearing a grubby apron. He is 
quite old, bald and has an ugly black scar running 
down his right cheek. Not all the customers are 
human. Will you: 
[1] Walk to the bar to talk to the innkeeper? 
[2] Sit down at a table with three Dwarfs who are playing a dice game? 
[3] sit down at a table with two Goblins who are arguing? 
[4] Sit down with three men who are sticking daggers quickly between their fingers on the table? 
[5] Leave the tavern and walk north?
