The old wooden doors open into a dingy, smokefilled room. There are eight round tables in the centre of the room with some of the most mean and shifty-looking rogues you have ever seen sitting at them. At the back of the tavern is a long wooden bar covered with bottles and mugs. Behind the bar stands the innkeeper wearing a grubby apron. He is quite old, bald and has an ugly black scar running down his right cheek. Not all the customers are human. Will you:
