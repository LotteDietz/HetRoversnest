A small bell rings as the door opens and a creature 
wearing a brown apron over his clothing hurries 
through the archway from the back room into the 
shop to stand behind the counter. He appears 
human-like but has very ugly facial features and 
pointed teeth. You realize he is a crossbreed, half 
man, half orc. A sharp hand-axe hangs from his belt 
to remind you that Port Blacksand is unlikely to be a 
friendly place in which to do business. Will you: 
[1] Inquire about the herbs?
[2] Ask if the Man-Orc knows of Nicodemus?
[3] Attack the Man-Orc?
