When you draw your sword the man cries out and runs into a back room. You follow him into the room. He is apparently unarmed, but is holding an egg and a small key in his hands. He warns you that the egg contains a deadly gas and he will throw it at you. He also threatens to swallow the key to his silver cupboard.
