When you draw your sword the man cries out and 
runs into a back room. You follow him into the 
room. He is apparently unarmed, but is holding an 
egg and a small key in his hands. He warns you that 
the egg contains a deadly gas and he will throw it at 
you. He also threatens to swallow the key to his 
silver cupboard. 
[1] If you still wish to attack him
[2] If you wish to run out of the shop and go 
further up Clog Street
