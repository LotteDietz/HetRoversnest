The Dwarf jumps up off his stool, his face full of 
hatred. He calls out two names loudly and two huge 
black dogs immediately appear from under a table 
with long fangs protruding from their slavering 
mouths. Wraggins points a finger at you, shouting 
"Kill the friend of Nicodemus!' and the dogs leap at 
you, barking wildly. You must fight them for your 
life, one at a time.
