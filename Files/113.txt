You enter the house and find yourself standing in a room full of toys. But they are not ordinary toys. These are stuffed creatures with nails through their heads, dolls' houses that are made to look as if they are on fire, and many other unpleasant objects. In the middle of the room stand two old women dressed as though they were little girls. They are squabbling over a carved wooden duck. Each looks eager to destroy the duck with the knives they are holding. On seeing you the women both start to shout, 'Give us toys! Give us toys!'
