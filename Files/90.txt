You swing your sword with all your strength and 
bring it down on the heavy chain. Much to your 
surprise il bounces off. Before you have time to try 
again, you are surrounded by four town guards 
who are pointing their pikes at you. Will you: 
[1] Tell them vou have caught the escaped prisoner for them?
[2] Offer them a bribe to let you and the prisoner go free?
