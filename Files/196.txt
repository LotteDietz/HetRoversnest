You arrive at a tour-way junction in the street. The 
street continuing west changes its name to Key 
Street, and the street running north and south is 
called Market Street. Looking north you seea crowd 
of people walking up the street cheering loudly and 
waving their arms in the air. You decide to follow 
them.
