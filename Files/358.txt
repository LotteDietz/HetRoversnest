It's a close shave, but you just manage to grip the 
edge of the wall with your fingertips. You pull 
yourself up and climb on to a stone walkway along 
the top of the city wall. On either side of you are 
stone towers rising above the battlements, spaced 
some hundred metres apart. There are doors in 
the towers, both of which arc suddenly flung open 
as more guards run oul to capture you. There is a 
twenty-metre drop on the other side of the wall. 
Will you: 
[1] Jump to freedom?
[2] Fix a Climbing Rope (if you have one) to the wall and climb down the other side?
[3] Face the oncoming guards?
