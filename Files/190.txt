Sitting down at the table the men invite you to join in their game of pin-finger. You feel obliged to accept their challenge and take hold of a dagger offered to you. The men tell you that you must stick the point of the dagger back and forth between your fingers into the table top as fast as you can for a minute. If you manage not to stab yourself they will give you a magic item. If you do stab yourself you must give them 5 gold pieces. Test your skill.
