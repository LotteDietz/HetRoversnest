Sitting down at the table the men invite you to join 
in their game of pin-finger. You feel obliged to 
accept their challenge and take hold of a dagger 
offered to you. The men tell you that you must stick 
the point of the dagger back and forth between your 
fingers into the table top as fast as you can for a 
minute. If you manage not to stab yourself they will 
give you a magic item. If you do stab yourself you 
must give them 5 Gold Pieces. Test your skill

@0:You are unable to control 
the fast movement of the dagger and stab one of 
your fingers. You toss 5 Gold Pieces on the table and 
stand up to leave the tavern. Outside you head 
north again.@G-5,295
