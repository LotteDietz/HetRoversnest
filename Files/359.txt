All the Bays on your side rush over to you and 
slap your hands with theirs. They are overjoyed at 
their victory. Supporters run over and start handing 
you gifts. Eventually you manage to wriggle free 
from your admirers and find a place to sit down to 
inspect your gifts. You have been given 8 Gold 
Pieces, a bottle containing a clear liquid labelled 
'Potion of Mind Control', a silver flute, a bunch of 
bananas, a piece of chalk and an eye-patch. You eal 
the bananas (add 2 stamina points) and place the 
rest of the items in your backpack. You climb back 
over the wall before the Bays start another game, 
walk back to the junction and head west along 
Harbour Street.
