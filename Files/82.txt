Before the hag can complete her spell, you reach 
into your backpack and take out the bottle containing the potion. You gulp down the liquid and feel its 
effects immediately. The hag is still mouthing her 
vile sorcery but you cannot hear her. Safe from her 
evil, you draw your sword and step forward. You 
grab hold of her matted hair and cut a clump from 
her head. She writhes and kicks and spits at you. At 
this close range you can see fresh blood on her face: 
no doubt she could not wait to cook some of the 
rats she had killed. Despite your repulsion you are 
excited about having gained one of the items necessary to defeat the Night Prince. You throw the Hag 
into the sewer and walk back to the entrance hole.
