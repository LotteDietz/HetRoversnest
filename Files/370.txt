You place the coin in the slot and walk through the 
turnstile. Although the flowers and shrubs are not 
outstanding, you arc nevertheless surprised that 
such a place exists in Port Blacksand. The gardens 
are not very large, extending back some sixty metres 
to where some houses back on to them. There are 
two paths to follow, one of which runs around the 
edge of the gardens and one that leads directly into 
the centre, where there is some lopiary - each shrub 
has been cut into the shape of an animal - and you 
decide to take a closer look. The path leads into a 
small paved area surrounded by many animal-shaped 
shrubs. In the middle there is a stone plinth upon 
which sits a large earthen bowl containing lotus 
flowers! There is a painted sign which reads 'Do Not 
Pick the Flowers'. The gardener is nowhere to be 
seen and there is nobody else about.
