The blacksmith removes his gloves and wipes his 
hands on his apron before asking you what you 
want. You answer by asking if he makes anything 
besides horseshoes. He replies that in his spare time 
he enjoys making chainmail coats. In fact it has 
become quite a profitable sideline of his, especially 
in a place like Port Blacksand. He tells you in great 
detail of the skill and labour that goes into making 
one and finally inquires if you are interested in 
buying one. They are not cheap.
