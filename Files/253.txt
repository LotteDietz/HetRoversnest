The snakes are not very tough opponents for a 
person trained in the art of swordsmanship. Treat 
them as a single creature. However, each Attack 
Round that they inflict a wound on you, 4 points 
must be subtracted from your stamina score because of their poisonous bite. If you win, you may leave the house by the front 
door.
