When you have paid the man-orc the 4 gold pieces, 
he explains that placing the herbs on a wound will 
help to heal it. Unfortunately the strength of the 
mixture varies. When required, roll 1 die. 
The number rolled is the number of stamina points that will 
be restored. Somewhat surprised at your good fortune you leave the shop and walk north. Add 1 
luck point.
