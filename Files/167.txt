When you have paid the Man-Ore the 4 Gold Pieces, 
he explains that placing the herbs on a wound will 
help to heal it. Unfortunately the strength of the 
mixture varies. When required, roll 1 die. The num- 
ber rolled is the number of stamina points that will 
be restored. Somewhat surprised at your good for- 
tune you leave the shop and walk north. Add 1 
luck point.
