When you have paid the man-orc the 4 gold pieces, he explains that placing the herbs on a wound will help to heal it. Unfortunately the strength of the mixture varies. When required, roll 1 die. The number rolled is the number of stamina points that will be restored. Somewhat surprised at your good fortune you leave the shop and walk north. Add 1 luck point.
