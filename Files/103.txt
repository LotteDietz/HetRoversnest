You arrive at a four-way junction in the street. The 
street continuing east changes its name to Clock 
Street and the street running north and south is 
called Market Street. Looking north you see a crowd 
of people walking up the street cheering loudly and 
waving their arms in the air. You decide to follow 
them.
