The staircase ends at a door. You turn the handle 
slowly and the door opens, much to your surprise, 
into open air. You walk outside on to the flat roof of 
the lower. Suddenly you are aware of movement in 
the sky and look up to see two large birds in the 
moonlight with long beaks and talons swooping 
down on you. There is no time to run for cover, and 
you must fight the two death hawks. 
Fight them one at a time.
