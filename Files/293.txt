She explains that she has just picked one of her 
golden flowers. There are ten golden petals on the 
flower, and you are told that if dipped in dog's 
blood, each petal, plucked and thrown on the 
ground, will change into a gold piece. Mrs Pipe asks 
for any magic item, piece of armour or two provisions 
in exchange for the golden flower.
[1] Buy the flowers for a magic item?
[2] Buy the flowers for a piece of armor?
[3] Buy the flowers for two provisions?
[4] Leave the shop and head west (turn to 24).
