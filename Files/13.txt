Inspecting the scorpion you see that it is a brooch. 
You decide to pin it to your leather tunic. The 
brooch has magic healing properties: after any bat- 
tle, the brooch will immediately restore 1 stamina 
point to your total. 
What will you do next? 
[1] You may, if you have not 
already done so, pick up the golden scorpion
[2] If you would rather ignore it, you may either 
climb the stairs
[3] or leave the house and head north
