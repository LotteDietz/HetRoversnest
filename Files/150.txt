The Troll bursts out laughing and says, 'Fooled you! 
There isn't a Pepper Street in Port Blacksandl' His 
face folds into a sickly grin and he tells you that you 
are under arrest for being in Port Blacksand without 
authorization. He tells you that he is feeling gener- 
ous, however, and offers you a choice. You can pay 
a fine of all the gold in your backpack and be thrown 
out of the city, or spend a year with rats and 
cockroaches in a dirty dungeon cell. The oilier Troll 
bursts out laughing, saying, 'Generous? Ho! Ho! 
Ho! Ah, Sourbelly, you've got such a sense of 
humour!' 
[1] If you wish to pay the fine and be thrown 
out of the city
[2] If you wish to resist 
arrest
