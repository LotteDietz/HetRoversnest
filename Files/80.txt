The stairs lead into a small room, again painted red. 
Sitting at a table is a strange creature with a long 
snout and deep red, scaly skin. From its jaw pro- 
trude rows of sharp leeth and a long pink tongue 
darts quickly in and out between them. The creature 
looks up and stares at you. Are you wearing a 
scorpion brooch?
