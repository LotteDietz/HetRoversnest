The tattooist looks at you with a bored expression 
on his face and says, 'Well, you don't expect me to 
do it for free, do you? If you've got anything worth 
selling, go next door. My step-brother lives there 
and he's a pawnbroker. Tell him 1 sent you and 
maybe he'll give you a good price.' You walk outside and knock on the wooden door of the next 
house. A squint-eyed man opens the door and you 
tell him that you want to sell some items so that you 
can afford to have a tattoo. The man asks you to 
come into his house and you enler a room piled high 
with all kinds of objects, furniture, armour, curiosities 
and pottery. He explains that he has a stall in the 
market which he rents once a week. He then tells 
you what he is currently interested in buying, and 
the prices he is offering. You may sell the pawnbroker any of your possessions.
