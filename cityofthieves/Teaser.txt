Terror stalks the night as Zanbar Bone and his bloodthirsty moon dogs hold the prosperous town of Silverton to ransom. You are the adventurer, and the merchants of Silverton turn to you in their hour of need. Your mission takes you along dark, twisting streets where thieves, vagabonds and creatures of the night lie in wait to trap the unwary traveller. And beyond lies the most fearsome adventure of them all: the tower stronghold of Zanbar Bone! You decide which route to take, which creatures to fight and which dangers to risk.
